# Languages
A work-in-progress addon that aims to bring in "speakable" ingame languages in a lightweight and accessible way.

There are many things to do:
- Functional conversion of messages into image textures per-character
- Convert heiroglyphs into atlas textures
- Fix over-character limit issue
- Potentially adjust for "true languages" ie Horde characters speaking Orcish where the language tag isn't actually detected - possibly add option to hide the default language tag
- option to remove language tags from speech bubbles
- Set up profiling system
  - Text color selection option
  - "Languages learned" options
  - TRP3 Profile Integration
  - Heiroglyph toggles
- Build frames for options
- Slash commands
- Create dictionary (ie "Giant's Heart" = "Grommash")
- Find decent integration into the UI, minimap button? character tab? skill section?
- Figure out how to treat default languages
