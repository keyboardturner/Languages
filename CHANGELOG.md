# 1.0.0

Reworked the language list code, allowing for Favorites and a Search

Added Dialect tab with several premade dialects to choose from (still a work-in-progress)
 - Dialect allows for toggling individual changed words, and a manual override cancel where a term is surrounded by underscores (and removing the underscores)

Language alphabet rune & spacing width rescaled to better fit the characters (Thanks to TrinitysEnd for helping convert many of the existing textures)

New Translation tooltip upon prefix mouseover & window upon click which shows the original untranslated message (Thanks to Peterodox for hyperlink functionality)

New "Mini-Button" frame has been added, allowing for easier known language selection and switching the prefix on/off

New "Only In Character" setting has been added for Total RP 3 users, automatically switching the prefix on/off depending on on-character status

New Glyph Size slider setting has been added to manually adjust glyph size independent of chat size

Certain proper nouns / words remain untranslated in their respective language, while certain words translate properly to lore-established terms

Capitalization is now retained, and certain characters such as periods, commas, and hyphens will pass through untranslated

New profiles will start with the Gameplay preset

Removed option to have addon function in combat as per impending Midnight API changes - addon simply doesn't work in combat
